# PRISM
**Participation Routines & Inclusive Supports Map**
*A structured observation guide for P/TK participation planning*

## What It Is

PRISM is a participation mapping tool for inclusive early childhood settings. It helps P/TK teachers document how a child's access to classroom activities shifts across contexts — and why — in language that IEP teams can use directly.

It is not an assessment battery. It does not produce scores or eligibility determinations. It produces structured participation documentation that informs IEP present levels and supports least restrictive environment reasoning.

**Use it when:**
- A child is being evaluated or receiving services in a P/TK setting
- The IEP team needs ecological data from the classroom teacher of record
- Present Levels need to describe participation patterns, not test-room performance
- The team is reasoning about LRE placement or supports

## How It Works

PRISM guides the teacher through three domain sections — Approaches to Learning (ATL), Social-Emotional Development (SED), and Self-Regulation (REG) — then a consolidated Synthesis. Each domain asks the teacher to:

1. Rate participation across four classroom contexts (whole group, small group, free play/centers, transitions)
2. Check indicators consistently observed
3. Select the best access context and most constrained context

The Synthesis section collects:
- Primary and secondary environmental driver (what explains participation shifts)
- Domain pattern classification (consistent / context-dependent / high support)
- Support profile — UDL/universal supports present vs. individually planned supports required
- Observation scope

Hitting **Generate Participation Summary** assembles a Present Levels paragraph from the structured data using a local clause-module renderer — no API, no network connection required. Output includes a timestamped attribution footer.

## Framework Alignment

| Framework | Connection |
|-----------|------------|
| **California PTKLF (2024)** | Organized around ATL, SED, and REG foundation areas |
| **DRDP (CDE/WestEd)** | Compatible domain structure; supports rating rationale documentation |
| **AEPS-3** | Complementary — PRISM provides context data; AEPS-3 provides skill-strand data |
| **ECTA Preschool LRE Guidance** | Context contrast structure maps directly to ECTA LRE reasoning framework |

## Using PRISM

**No installation required.** Open `index.html` in any modern browser.

- Works offline — no internet connection needed after loading
- Autosaves to browser localStorage — form survives page refresh
- Student ID field accepts initials or anonymous identifier — no PII required
- Clear Assessment button resets all fields with confirmation

**For GitHub Pages:** the tool is live at the repo's Pages URL. Teachers can bookmark it directly.

## Versioning

`PRISM v1.0 · February 2026`

Modifications should be versioned and re-documented to preserve alignment integrity. Fork this repo, increment the version stamp in the tool footer and README, and update the Origin Memo accordingly.
